- **Natural Language Processing**
- **High-Performance Computing**

## Featured Projects

### [DPO for Paraphrase Type Generation](https://github.com/cluebbers/dpo-rlhf-paraphrase-types)
Investigated alignment methods (DPO, RLHF) for precise paraphrasing.

### [HPDA_with_R](https://github.com/cluebbers/Using_R_for_HPDA)
A comprehensive exploration of using R for high-performance data analytics, covering memory management, GPU computing, parallel processing, and comparative analysis with Python. Includes benchmarks, case studies, and code examples.

### [Meh-Tricks: Towards Reproducible Results in NLP](https://github.com/cluebbers/Reproducibility-METEOR-NLP)
Investigates the reproducibility of METEOR, BLEU, and ROUGE scores in NLP research. Includes a systematic literature review, software validation testing, and code for analyzing evaluation protocols and packages.

### [DeepNLP_SS23](https://github.com/cluebbers/NLP_DeepLearning_Spring2023)
Implementations of BERT and sBERT for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and semantic textual similarity.
